### Piet: A browser-based query interface to Mondrian

Piet is a work in progress, still in the early stages of development. For more information, reach out to us at info@ojbc.org.

Or fork, clone, and build with `mvn install`.  The result will be a `piet.war` file in the `target` directory that you can drop into
Tomcat.  Once we are able to start performing queries, you'll need [mondrian-rest](https://github.com/ojbc/mondrian-rest) in your Tomcat webapps
directory too.

We will update this space as development proceeds.
